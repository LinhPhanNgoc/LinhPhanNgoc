Problem:
   An object’s momentum is its mass multiplied by its velocity.
   Write a program that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as inputs and then outputs its momentum.
Solution:
    ....
"""
mass = float(input("Enter the mass = "))
velocity = float(input("Enter the velocity = "))
momentum = mass * velocity
print("Momentum = ",momentum )
