Problem:
   Explain the role of the trailing else part of an extended if statement
Solution:
   The multi-way if statement considers each condition until one evaluates to True or they all evaluate to False.
   When a condition evaluates to True, the corresponding action is performed and control skips to the end of the entire selection statement.
   If no condition evaluates to True, then the action after the trailing else is performed.
