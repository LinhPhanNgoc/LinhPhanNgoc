Problem:
   1. Translate the following for loops to equivalent while loops:
   a. for count in range(100):
         print(count)
   b. for count in range(1, 101):
         print(count)
   c. for count in range(100, 0, â€“1):
         print(count)
Solution:
   a. count = 0
      while count <= 99
          count += 1
      print(count)
   b. count = 1
      while count <= 100
          count += 1
      print(count)
   c. count = 100
      while count >= 1
          count -= 1
      print(count)
    ....
