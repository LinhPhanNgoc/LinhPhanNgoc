Problem:
   Why does Python code generate fewer types of syntax errors than code in other programming languages?
Solution:
   Software is written in programming languages. Languages such as Python are high level; they resemble English and allow authors to express their algorithms clearly to other people. A program called an interpreter translates a Python program to a lower-level form that can be executed on a real computer.
   The Python shell provides a command prompt for evaluating and viewing the results of Python expressions and statements. IDLE is an integrated development environment that allows the programmer to save programs in files and load them into a shell for testing.
   Python scripts are programs that are saved in files and run from a terminal command prompt. An interactive script consists of a set of input statements, statements that process these inputs, and statements that output the results.
   When a Python program is executed, it is translated into byte code. This byte code is then sent to the Python virtual machine (PVM) for further interpretation and execution.
   Syntax is the set of rules for forming correct expressions and statements in a programming language. When the interpreter encounters a syntax error in a Python program, it halts execution with an error message. Two examples of syntax errors are a reference to a variable that does not yet have a value and an indentation that is unexpected.
