Problem:
   You can calculate the surface area of a cube if you know the length of an edge.
   Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints the cubeâ€™s surface area as output.
Solution:
    ....
"""
a = int(input("length = "))
surfacearea = a * a * 6
print("The surface area is =", surfacearea, "square units")
